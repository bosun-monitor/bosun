Scollector is a metric collection agent for OpenTSDB 2.0 and Bosun.

tcollector (https://github.com/OpenTSDB/tcollector) is OpenTSDB's data
collection framework built for OpenTSDB 1.0. scollector aims to be tcollector
for OpenTSDB 2.0 and is one method of sending data to Bosun (http://bosun.org/)
for monitoring.

Unlike tcollector, scollector is a single binary where all collectors are
compiled into scollector itself. scollector supports external collectors, but
your goal should be to use those temporarily until the go version is written or
the target system send data directly to OpenTSDB or Bosun. scollector has
native collectors for Linux, Darwin, and Windows and can pull data from other
systems such as AWS, SNMP, and vSphere.

Usage:
	scollector [flag]

The flags are:

	-h=""
		OpenTSDB or Bosun host. Overrides Host in conf file.
	-f=""
		Filters collectors matching these terms, separated by
		comma. Overrides Filter in conf file.
	-b=0
		OpenTSDB batch size. Default is 500.
	-conf=""
		Location of configuration file. Defaults to scollector.toml in directory of
		the scollector executable.
	-l
		List available collectors (after Filter is applied).
	-m
		Disable sending of metadata.
	-version
		Prints the version and exits.

Additional flags on Windows:
	-winsvc=""
		Windows Service management; can be: install, remove, start, stop

Debug flags:
	-d
		enables debug output
	-p
		print to screen instead of sending to a host
	-fake=0
		generates X fake data points per second on the test.fake metric

The only required paremeter is the host, which may be specified in the conf
file or with -h.

Warning

scollector has not been tested outside of the Stack Exchange environment, and
thus may act incorrectly elsewhere.

scollector requires the new HTTP API of OpenTSDB 2.1 with gzip support. Ensure
that is in use if not using the OpenTSDB docker image.

Logs

If started with -p or -d, scollector logs to Stdout. Otherwise, on Unixes,
scollector logs to syslog. On Windows when started as a service, the Event Log
is used.

External Collectors

See http://bosun.org/scollector/external-collectors for details about using
external scripts or programs to collect metrics.

Configuration File

If scollector.toml exists in the same directory as the scollector
executable or is specified via the -conf="" flag, it's content
will be used to set configuration flags. The format is toml
(https://github.com/toml-lang/toml/blob/master/versions/en/toml-v0.2.0.md).
Available keys are:

Host (string): the OpenTSDB or Bosun host to send data, supports TLS and
HTTP Basic Auth.

	Host = "https://user:password@example.com/"

FullHost (boolean): enables full hostnames: doesn't truncate to first ".".

ColDir (string): is the external collectors directory.

Tags (table of strings): are added to every datapoint. If a collector specifies
the same tag key, this one will be overwritten. The host tag is not supported.

Hostname (string): overrides the system hostname.

DisableSelf (boolean): disables sending of scollector self metrics.

Freq (integer): is the default frequency in seconds for most collectors.

BatchSize (integer): is the number of metrics that will be sent in each batch.
Default is 500.

Filter (array of string): filters collectors matching these terms.

MetricFilters (array of string): filters metrics matching these regular
expressions.

IfaceExpr (string): Replaces the default regular expression for interface name
matching on Linux.

PProf (string): optional IP:Port binding to be used for debugging with pprof.
Examples: localhost:6060 for loopback or :6060 for all IP addresses.

Collector configuration keys

Following are configurations for collectors that do not autodetect.

KeepalivedCommunity (string): if not empty, enables the Keepalived collector
with the specified community.

	KeepalivedCommunity = "keepalivedcom"

          BaseOid = ".48.1.1.1" #common base oid for this tree

          # tags to apply to metrics in this tree. Can come from another oid, or specify "idx" to use
          # the numeric index as the tag value. Can specify multiple tags, but must supply one.
          # all tags and metrics should have the same number of rows per query.
