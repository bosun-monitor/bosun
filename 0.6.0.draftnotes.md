# 0.6.0-beta Release Notes

**(Note: I intend to keep this release in draft. This is so I can work on the release notes and have them ready for the beta release)**

## Bosun

The main goal of Bosun 0.6.0 was to smooth out the alert creation and editing workflow. Previously, users would have to copy the configuration from Bosun's UI, get it to the server, and then restart the process. Now users can edit the config directly from Bosun's UI, and the changes will be loaded without restarting the bosun process. Since the rules can now be edited via Bosun's UI, authorization via LDAP and SSL support has been added as well.


### Major Changes:

 - Bosun's configuration file has been split into two files: 
    - [RuleConf](https://bosun.org) which contains all definitions.
    - [System configuration](https://bosun.org/system_configuration).
 - Bosun's [RuleConf](https://bosun.org/definitions) can now be [edited via Bosun's UI](https://bosun.org/usage#definition-rule-saving). The changes can then be reloaded without restarting the Bosun process.
 - Bosun now has support for [authorization](https://bosun.org/admin#authentication) via LDAP and Tokens that can be configured via the [auth section of the system configuration](https://bosun.org/system_configuration#authconf).
 - Bosun's dashboard loads much faster than 0.5.0 due to schema change
 - Many [errors can now be handled in templates](https://bosun.org/definitions#template-error-handling) making them more robust against runtime errors, and [template documentation](https://bosun.org/definitions#templates) has been improved.

### Upgrading
 - Since the configuration file has been split, you will need to move some of what used be in the config into [system configuration](https://bosun.org/system_configuration).
 - On the first execution, a database schema migration will take place that can take several minutes. During this time bosun will not be available. It is recommended to back up Bosun's database before the upgrade.

### Other Changes
 - New Expression Functions:
   - [`timedelta`](https://bosun.org/expressions#timedeltaseriesset-seriesset)
   - `esnot`, `esexists`, and `esmonthly` [elastic functions](https://bosun.org/expressions#elastic-query-functions)
   - [`crop`](https://bosun.org/expressions#cropseries-seriesset-start-numberset-end-numberset-seriesset)
   - [`tail`](https://bosun.org/expressions#tailseriesset-num-numberset-seriesset)
   - [`map`](https://bosun.org/expressions#mapseries-seriesset-subexpr-numbersetexpr-seriesset) [#1813](https://github.com/bosun-monitor/bosun/pull/1813).
   - [`addtags`](https://bosun.org/expressions#addtagsseriesset-group-string-seriesset)
   - [`leftjoin`](https://bosun.org/expressions#leftjointagscsv-string-datacsv-string-numberset-table)
   - `antable`, `ancounts`, and `andurations` [annotation functions](http://bosun.org/expressions#annotation-query-functions).
   - [`remove`](https://bosun.org/expressions#removeseriesset-string-seriesset)
 - New Template Functions / Variables: `notNil`, `.LastError`, and `.Errors`
 - Comments are now allowed in the Expression Page in Bosun's UI.
 - Bosun's navbar now shows if quiet mode is enabled.
 - Notes can now be added to incidents.
 - Improved Bosun's incident view.
 - Improved Bosun's graph page to be more keyboard friendly: better order of fields with the TAB key and shift-enter within text fields will execute.
 - Updated Influx library to be compatible with current versions.
 - Optimized elastic query performance by not fetching indices and fix bug caused by indices not being part of the cache key [#1931](https://github.com/bosun-monitor/bosun/pull/1931).
 - Fixed issue in scheduler where adjacent runs would be given the same to represent "now" [#2029](https://github.com/bosun-monitor/bosun/pull/2029).
 - Allow the empty tagset to be a dependency for alerts that have tags [#2027](https://github.com/bosun-monitor/bosun/pull/2027).
 - Adjustments to Bosun's UI to make it more vertically compact.
 - Fixed HTTP template funcs to have a shorter timeout so they don't block template rendering for too long when they timeout.
 - Allow empty tagsets in silence silence: allow empty tag sets [#1860](https://github.com/bosun-monitor/bosun/pull/1860).
 
 ### Expected Changes Between Beta and 0.6.0 final:
  - Tooling outside of the Bosun process doesn't have auth support (except for the Grafana Plugin). The following will have auth support before final: scollector, (cli tools: annotate, silence), tsdbrelay, BosunReporter.NET, and Opserver.
  - Support for multiple Elastic backends in a single instance may be added. If this happens the syntax for the system configuration (toml file) of elastic might change.
