# The Influx Query Language Specification

## Introduction

This is a reference for the Influx Query Language ("InfluxQL").

InfluxQL is a SQL-like query language for interacting with InfluxDB.  It has been lovingly crafted to feel familiar to those coming from other SQL or SQL-like environments while providing features specific to storing and analyzing time series data.

## Notation

The syntax is specified using Extended Backus-Naur Form ("EBNF").  EBNF is the same notation used in the [Go](http://golang.org) programming language specification, which can be found [here](https://golang.org/ref/spec).  Not so coincidentally, InfluxDB is written in Go.

```
Production  = production_name "=" [ Expression ] "." .
Expression  = Alternative { "|" Alternative } .
Alternative = Term { Term } .
Term        = production_name | token [ "‚Ä¶" token ] | Group | Option | Repetition .
Group       = "(" Expression ")" .
Option      = "[" Expression "]" .
Repetition  = "{" Expression "}" .
```

Notation operators in order of increasing precedence:

```
|   alternation
()  grouping
[]  option (0 or 1 times)
{}  repetition (0 to n times)
```

## Query representation

### Characters

InfluxQL is Unicode text encoded in [UTF-8](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8).

```
newline             = /* the Unicode code point U+000A */ .
unicode_char        = /* an arbitrary Unicode code point except newline */ .
```

## Letters and digits

Letters are the set of ASCII characters plus the underscore character _ (U+005F) is considered a letter.

Only decimal digits are supported.

```
letter              = ascii_letter | "_" .
ascii_letter        = "A" ‚Ä¶ "Z" | "a" ‚Ä¶ "z" .
digit               = "0" ‚Ä¶ "9" .
```

## Identifiers

Identifiers are tokens which refer to database names, retention policy names, user names, measurement names, tag keys, and field names.

The rules:

- double quoted identifiers can contain any unicode character other than a new line
- double quoted identifiers can contain escaped `"` characters (i.e., `\"`)
- unquoted identifiers must start with an upper or lowercase ASCII character or "_"
- unquoted identifiers may contain only ASCII letters, decimal digits, and "_"

```
identifier          = unquoted_identifier | quoted_identifier .
unquoted_identifier = ( letter ) { letter | digit } .
quoted_identifier   = `"` unicode_char { unicode_char } `"` .
```

#### Examples:

```
cpu
_cpu_stats
"1h"
"anything really"
"1_Crazy-1337.identifier>NAMEüëç"
```

## Keywords

CREATE       CONTINUOUS   DATABASE     DATABASES    DEFAULT      DELETE

USERS        VALUES       WHERE        WITH         WRITE
```

## Literals

### Integers

InfluxQL supports decimal integer literals.  Hexadecimal and octal literals are not currently supported.

```
int_lit             = ( "1" ‚Ä¶ "9" ) { digit } .
```

### Floats

InfluxQL supports floating-point literals.  Exponents are not currently supported.

```
float_lit           = int_lit "." int_lit .
```

### Strings

String literals must be surrounded by single quotes. Strings may contain `'` characters as long as they are escaped (i.e., `\'`).

```
string_lit          = `'` { unicode_char } `'`' .
```

### Durations

Duration literals specify a length of time.  An integer literal followed immediately (with no spaces) by a duration unit listed below is interpreted as a duration literal.

### Duration units
| Units  | Meaning                                 |
|--------|-----------------------------------------|
| u or ¬µ | microseconds (1 millionth of a second)  |
| ms     | milliseconds (1 thousandth of a second) |
| s      | second                                  |
| m      | minute                                  |
| h      | hour                                    |
| d      | day                                     |
| w      | week                                    |

```
duration_lit        = int_lit duration_unit .
duration_unit       = "u" | "¬µ" | "s" | "h" | "d" | "w" | "ms" .
```

### Dates & Times

The date and time literal format is not specified in EBNF like the rest of this document.  It is specified using Go's date / time parsing format, which is a reference date written in the format required by InfluxQL.  The reference date time is:

InfluxQL reference date time: January 2nd, 2006 at 3:04:05 PM

```
time_lit            = "2006-01-02 15:04:05.999999" | "2006-01-02"
```

### Booleans

```
bool_lit            = TRUE | FALSE .
```

### Regular Expressions

```
regex_lit           = "/" { unicode_char } "/" .
```

## Queries

A query is composed of one or more statements separated by a semicolon.

```
query               = statement { ; statement } .

statement           = alter_retention_policy_stmt |
                      create_continuous_query_stmt |
                      create_database_stmt |

                               [ retention_policy_option ]
                               [ retention_policy_option ] .

db_name                      = identifier .

```

#### Examples:
