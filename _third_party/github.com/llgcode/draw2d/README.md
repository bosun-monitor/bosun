Package draw2d is a pure [go](http://golang.org) 2D vector graphics library with support for multiple output devices such as [images](http://golang.org/pkg/image) (draw2d), pdf documents (draw2dpdf) and opengl (draw2dgl), which can also be used on the google app engine. It can be used as a pure go [Cairo](http://www.cairographics.org/) alternative. draw2d is released under the BSD license. See the [documentation](http://godoc.org/github.com/llgcode/draw2d) for more details.

Click on an image above to get the pdf, generated with exactly the same draw2d code. The first image is the output of `samples/geometry`. The second image is the result of `samples/postcript`, which demonstrates that draw2d can draw postscript files into images or pdf documents with the [ps](https://github.com/llgcode/ps) package.

Features
--------

Operations in draw2d include stroking and filling polygons, arcs, BÃ©zier curves, drawing images and text rendering with truetype fonts. All drawing operations can be transformed by affine transformations (scale, rotation, translation).

Package draw2d follows the conventions of the [HTML Canvas 2D Context](http://www.w3.org/TR/2dcontext/) for coordinate system, angles, etc...

Installation
------------

Install [golang](http://golang.org/doc/install). To install or update the package draw2d on your system, run:

Stable release
```
go get -u gopkg.in/llgcode/draw2d.v1
```

or Current release
```
go get -u github.com/llgcode/draw2d
```


Quick Start
-----------

The following Go code generates a simple drawing and saves it to an image file with package draw2d:

```go
// Initialize the graphic context on an RGBA image
dest := image.NewRGBA(image.Rect(0, 0, 297, 210.0))
gc := draw2dimg.NewGraphicContext(dest)

// Set some properties
gc.SetFillColor(color.RGBA{0x44, 0xff, 0x44, 0xff})
gc.SetStrokeColor(color.RGBA{0x44, 0x44, 0x44, 0xff})
gc.SetLineWidth(5)

// Draw a closed shape
gc.MoveTo(10, 10) // should always be called first for a new path
gc.LineTo(100, 50)
gc.QuadCurveTo(100, 10, 10, 10)
gc.Close()
gc.FillStroke()

// Save to file
draw2dimg.SaveToPngFile("hello.png", dest)
```

The same Go code can also generate a pdf document with package draw2dpdf:

```go
// Initialize the graphic context on an RGBA image
dest := draw2dpdf.NewPdf("L", "mm", "A4")
gc := draw2dpdf.NewGraphicContext(dest)

// Set some properties
gc.SetFillColor(color.RGBA{0x44, 0xff, 0x44, 0xff})
gc.SetStrokeColor(color.RGBA{0x44, 0x44, 0x44, 0xff})
gc.SetLineWidth(5)

// Draw a closed shape
gc.MoveTo(10, 10) // should always be called first for a new path
gc.LineTo(100, 50)
gc.QuadCurveTo(100, 10, 10, 10)
gc.Close()
gc.FillStroke()

// Save to file
draw2dpdf.SaveToPdfFile("hello.pdf", dest)
```

There are more examples here: https://github.com/llgcode/draw2d/tree/master/samples

Drawing on opengl is provided by the draw2dgl package.

Testing
-------

The samples are run as tests from the root package folder `draw2d` by:
```
go test ./...
```
Or if you want to run with test coverage:
```
go test -cover ./... | grep -v "no test"
```
This will generate output by the different backends in the output folder.

Acknowledgments
---------------

[Laurent Le Goff](https://github.com/llgcode) wrote this library, inspired by [Postscript](http://www.tailrecursive.org/postscript) and [HTML5 canvas](http://www.w3.org/TR/2dcontext/). He implemented the image and opengl backend with the [freetype-go](https://code.google.com/p/freetype-go/) package. Also he created a pure go [Postscript interpreter](https://github.com/llgcode/ps), which can read postscript images and draw to a draw2d graphic context. [Stani Michiels](https://github.com/stanim) implemented the pdf backend with the [gofpdf](https://github.com/jung-kurt/gofpdf) package.
