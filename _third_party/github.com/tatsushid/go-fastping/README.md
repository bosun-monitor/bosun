go-fastping
===========

go-fastping is a Go language port of Marc Lehmann's AnyEvent::FastPing Perl
module to send ICMP ECHO REQUEST packets quickly. Original Perl module is
available at
http://search.cpan.org/~mlehmann/AnyEvent-FastPing-2.01/

It hasn't been fully implemented original functions yet and only for IPv4 now.

## Installation

Install and update this go package with `go get -u github.com/tatsushid/go-fastping`

## Examples

Import this package and write

```go
p := fastping.NewPinger()
ra, err := net.ResolveIPAddr("ip4:icmp", os.Args[1])
if err != nil {
	fmt.Println(err)
	os.Exit(1)
}
p.AddIPAddr(ra)
p.AddHandler("receive", func(addr *net.IPAddr, rtt time.Duration) {
	fmt.Printf("IP Addr: %s receive, RTT: %v\n", addr.String(), rtt)
})
p.AddHandler("idle", func() {
	fmt.Println("finish")
})
p.Run()
```

It sends an ICMP packet and wait a response. If it receives a response, it
calls "receive" callback. After that, MaxRTT time passed, it calls "idle"
callback. For more detail, refer [godoc][godoc] and If you need more example,
please see "cmd/ping/ping.go".
