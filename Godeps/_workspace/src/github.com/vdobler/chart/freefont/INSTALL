		Installing the Free UCS outline fonts
		=====================================


These installation notes are supposed to provide a helpful guidance
through the process of installation of free UCS outline fonts. They
can probably be significantly improved. Please direct your comments,
suggestions for improvements, criticisms etc. to Primoz PETERLIN
<primoz.peterlin@biofiz.mf.uni-lj.si> and thus help improve them.


1. UNIX/GNU/Linux/BSD Systems

The rather awkward "UNIX/GNU/Linux/BSD" agglomeration is used to
denote any system capable of running XFree86 server with FreeType
<http://www.freetype.org/>, a high-quality free font rasterizer.

1.1 The rough way

Unfortunately, hardly any other way exists at the moment.

1) Fetch the freefont-ttf.tar.gz package with Free UCS outline fonts
   in the TrueType format.

2) Unpack TrueType fonts into a suitable directory,
   e.g. /usr/share/fonts/default/TrueType/.

3) If you have chosen any other directory, make sure the directory you
   used to install the fonts is listed in the path searched by the X
   Font Server. Append the directory to the "catalogue=" in the
   /etc/X11/fs/config.

4) Run ttmkfdir in the directory where you unpacked the fonts.


1.2 Debian GNU/Linux

Users of Debian GNU/Linux system will probably want to use the
pre-packed Debian package, as available from the Debian site, 
<http://packages.debian.org/unstable/x11/ttf-freefont.html>, or
any of its mirrors. You can install them by issuing the command

apt-get install ttf-freefont
