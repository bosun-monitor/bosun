This part of the documentation covers various aspects of Bosun administration. 

# Authentication
Bosun currently supports two types of authentication when authentication is enabled:

 1. LDAP authentication
 2. Token Based access

The two intended uses of these methods is user authentication and api authentication respectively. Authorization is a new feature in Bosun 0.6.0. Even when authorization is enabled, Bosun should still be run inside a trusted network.

## Setup
The authentication feature gets enabled when you define the [AuthConf section of the system configuration](/system_configuration#authconf). Authentication tokens can be set up via the UI by setting [AuthDisabled](/system_configuration#authdisabled) before authentication is enabled. `AuthDisabled` makes it so the authentication *feature* is enabled but authentication itself is not enabled. With `AuthDisabled` set to true anonymous users can create auth tokens via Bosun's user interface.

## Auth Token UI
When the authentication feature is enabled, you should see a <span class="docFromLabel">Manage Auth Tokens</span> menu item under your username in Bosun's UI in the upper right corner. You will be able to see this if `AuthDisabled` is true or if you have the `Manage Tokens` Permission set for your user.

From there you can create new auth tokens in two steps as show in the following images. Note that once you retrieve a token from the second screen, you will *not* be able to view the token itself again. You will still be able to see the name, description, permissions set, and the last time it was used.

First Screen:

Second Screen:

## Permissions and Roles
Permissions provide the ability to certain things with both, and Roles are a collection of permissions for convenience. A user could have no role and an arbitrary collection of permissions.
